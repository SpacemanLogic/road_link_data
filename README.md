# Docker Compose Road-Rails Project Readme

## Description
This Docker Compose project provides a simple setup for running a Jupyter Notebook server with specific Python packages in a container. It allows users to get started with Jupyter quickly and without the need to install Python packages or configure the environment manually.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-jupyter-compose.git
   cd docker-jupyter-compose
2. Create a requirements.txt file in the project directory with the Python packages you want to install. For example:
   ```bash
   numpy
   pandas
   matplotlib
3. Build the Docker image and start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   Access the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser at http://localhost:8888/lab.

You can now create, open, and work on Jupyter Notebooks within the /home/jovyan/work directory. Any notebooks you create or files you upload will be saved in this directory on your local machine.

4. To start the Jupyter server, use:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   
5. To stop the Jupyter server and remove the container, use:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
